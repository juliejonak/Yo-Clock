YO CLOCK is a time management extension that allows you to set a background timer to remind you to stay focused during your workflow
Have you ever found yourself searching for a quick answer, only to end up down the Reddit rabbit hole 2 hours later? Scrolling through Facebook for endless minutes?

- Allow the user to set a timer and task to do when the timer ends
- Timer runs in the background and sends a desktop notification when it ends
- Will auto-remind you to set a timer if you are on a page for more than 10 minutes

Stay on track and maximize your working time with Yo Clock! Simple to use, powerful help.

How does YO Clock work?

YO Clock will appear when you open a new tab. Simply input the number of minutes until you want the timer to go off, and the task you'd like to be reminded about, and hit "Go".

The button will turn green and say, "Timer started!" to indicate that the timer is running in the background. You can navigate to another page - the timer will still run.

YO Clock will also open a new tab when you've been on a page for more than 10 minutes, to give you the option to set a timer (in case you fell victim to Youtube or Reddit...once again...). If you don't want set one, simply close the tab.
